<h3>Fire and Smoke Detection ‚õëÔ∏è using AI and ML</h3>
This project aims to develop a model that can automatically detect fire and smoke in images and videos using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The project is supervised by Assistant Professor <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/iitg_faculty_details?name=Manish-Bhatt&fac=T1kyemJyQ0pPN1I3blVENllFWjQ5dz09">Manish Bhatt</a> of IIT Guwahati.

<h4>Motivation</h4>
Fire and smoke are common hazards that can cause severe damage to life and property. Early detection of fire and smoke can help in preventing or mitigating the consequences of such disasters. However, traditional fire and smoke detection methods, such as sensors and alarms, may not be effective in some scenarios, such as outdoor environments, large areas, or complex scenes. Therefore, there is a need for a system that can use the power of computer vision and deep learning to analyze visual data and identify fire and smoke events in real-time.

<h4>Objectives</h4>
The main objectives of this project are:
<ul>
<li>To collect and annotate a large-scale dataset of fire and smoke images and videos from various sources and scenarios.</li>
<li>To design and implement a deep neural network model that can accurately classify fire and smoke in images and videos.</li>
<li>To evaluate the performance of the model on various metrics, such as Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision, F1 score etc. and curves formed using these parameters</li>
<li>To provide real-time fire and smoke detection from camera feeds or user uploads.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Methodology</h4>
The methodology of this project consists of the following steps:

<h6>1Ô∏è‚É£Data collection:</h6> We will collect fire and smoke images and videos from various sources, such as online repositories, public datasets, social media platforms, etc. We will also capture our own data using cameras or drones in different scenarios, such as forests, buildings, vehicles, etc.

<h6>2Ô∏è‚É£Data annotation:</h6> We will manually label the collected data with binary labels (fire or smoke) or bounding boxes (for localization). We will use tools such as LabelImg or LabelMe to facilitate the annotation process.

<h6>3Ô∏è‚É£Data preprocessing:</h6> We will perform data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, resizing, flipping, rotating, etc., to increase the diversity and robustness of the data. We will also normalize the data to have zero mean and unit variance.

<h6>4Ô∏è‚É£Model development:</h6> We will design and implement a deep neural network model that can perform fire and smoke detection in images and videos. We will use frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the model. We will explore different architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or attention mechanisms, to achieve the best results.

<h6>5Ô∏è‚É£Model training:</h6> We will train the model on the preprocessed data using a suitable loss function, such as binary cross-entropy or mean squared error. We will use optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam, to update the model parameters. We will also use regularization techniques, such as dropout or batch normalization, to prevent overfitting.

<h6>6Ô∏è‚É£Model evaluation:</h6> We will evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. We will also compare the model with existing methods or baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.

<h6>7Ô∏è‚É£Model deployment:</h6> We will deploy the model on a web or mobile application that can provide real-time fire and smoke detection from camera feeds or user uploads. We will use tools such as Flask or Django for web development and Android Studio or Xcode for mobile development.

<h4>Results</h4>
We will present the results of our project in terms of:

<h6>1Ô∏è‚É£Data statistics:</h6> We will show the number of images and videos collected and annotated for fire and smoke detection. We will also show some examples of the data to illustrate its diversity and complexity.
<h6>2Ô∏è‚É£Model architecture:</h6> We will show the architecture of our deep neural network model that can perform fire and smoke detection in images and videos. We will explain the rationale behind choosing each layer and component of the model.
<h6>3Ô∏è‚É£Model performance:</h6> We will show the performance of our model on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., on the test set. We will also show some qualitative results of the model on sample images and videos to demonstrate its functionality.
<h6>4Ô∏è‚É£Model comparison:</h6> We will compare our model with existing methods or baselines on fire and smoke detection. We will highlight the advantages and limitations of our model over other methods.
<h4>5Ô∏è‚É£Conclusion</h4>
We will conclude our project by summarizing the main contributions and findings of our work. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations faced during the project execution. Finally, we will suggest some future directions for improvement or extension of our work.
